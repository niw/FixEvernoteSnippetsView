Usage
-----

Launch Evernote with injecting this dynamic link library using `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. Simply using `make` to do so. It requires Xcode.

    make

See `Makefile` and `dyld(1)` for the details.

Itâ€™s also possible to make a scripting addition to inject the patch, but I prefer to ask Evernote insiders to fix this.
