A dynamic link library that patches [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) snippets view that seems having a wrong configuration, which causes this strange effects.

Usage
-----

Inject this dynamic link library using `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`.
See `dyld(1)` for the details.

    env DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/libFixEvernoteSnippetsView.dylib /Applications/Evernote.app/Contents/MacOS/Evernote

Itâ€™s also possible to make a scripting addition to inject the patch, but I prefer to ask Evernote insiders to fix this.
